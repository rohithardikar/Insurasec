A Novel Hybrid Framework for Securing Health Insurance Data:


This project presents a Hybrid Framework designed to enhance the security of health insurance data. It combines dynamic DNA encoding, encryption (AES), compression, and steganography to
ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information. The data is encoded into a DNA sequence, securely stored in a cloud database, and protected against potential 
cyber threats and data breaches. This framework aims to address privacy concerns in the healthcare industry by safeguarding health insurance data while maintaining compliance with data
protection regulations. 

In this project, we use an innovative approach to secure health insurance data:

Dynamic DNA Encoding: Insurance data is encoded into DNA sequences.
Cloud Storage: The encoded data is stored securely in a cloud database.
Compression and Encryption: The data undergoes compression and encryption to further enhance security.
Steganography: Data is hidden using steganographic techniques to ensure that it is not easily visible or accessible by unauthorized entities.
AES Encryption: Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is used for encrypting the data, providing strong security.
